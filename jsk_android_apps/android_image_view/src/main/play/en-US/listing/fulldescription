Android app for subscribing and displaying ROS image topic

1. Run camera node on your machine:

        rosetip ;; this set ROS_IP with ip address (export ex, ROS_IP=192.168.111.5)
        rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node

2. Run 'ROS Image Viewer' on your Android device

3. It also publishes the touch event

        rostopic echo /touchEvent

  You can check the semantics of the data by following command

        $ rosmsg show jsk_gui_msgs/TouchEvent
        byte DOWN=0
        byte UP=1
        byte MOVE=2
        byte state
        float32 x
        float32 y
        float32 w
        float32 h


= Limitation

 Current version only subscribes image topic named `/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed`, so you need to use topic relay tool (http://wiki.ros.org/topic_tools/relay) to rename the image

= Trouble Shooting

 If you can not get any images on your android device, please make sure that your IP address can be reached from the android device. So set ROS_IP before you run camera node may solve this problem
